# **what?**
# When bots create a PR, this action will add a corresponding changie yaml file to that
# PR when a specific label is added.
#
# The file is created off a template:
#
# kind: <per action matrix>
# body: <PR title>
# time: <current timestamp>
# custom:
#   Author: <PR User Login (generally the bot)>
#   Issue: 4904
#   PR: <PR number>
#
# **why?**
# Automate changelog generation for more visability with automated bot PRs.
#
# **when?**
# Once a PR is created, label should be added to PR before or after creation. You can also
#  manually trigger this by adding the appropriate label at any time.
#
# **how to add another bot?**
# Add the label and changie kind to the include matrix.  That's it!
